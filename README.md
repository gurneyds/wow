# Ward Organization Workshop (WOW)

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for LDS Church leaders to help organize callings.

The idea is to show all callings within the stewardship of the person using the application and allow them to do "what if" scenarios of moving individuals to different callings.

Main features of the application should include the following:

1. Very visual to allow a person to get a broad view of all callings and details about each calling
  
  a-) Color coded to indicate duration within a calling (Green - very new, White - not new, Yellow - approaching the end, Red - time to release) These might be configurable options??
  
  b-) If a person has more than one calling, then use a red circular badge with a number inside to indicate how many callings
  
  c-) When a person is dragged to a new calling, the old person remains and the new person is added underneath. The visuals would show that this is a "what if" possibility. Multiple people could be added to the same calling to help with the decision process.
  
  d-) Maybe a pop-over would appear when right clicking to show the date when the person was sustained. Maybe a check mark to indicate if they have been set apart.
2. Drag and drop interface for quick and easy movement of individuals

3. Allowing for different "scenarios" that can be saved and reloaded

4. Maybe a bar (at the top?) with statistics about the number of callings, callings needing to be filled, people with multiple callings

5. Filter capability to bring to focus certain individuals like: (Other information would still be visible but maybe dimmed or faded out
  
  a-) Individuals in a calling for a "long" time that should be considered for a release.
  
  b-) Individuals with more than 1 calling
  
  c-) Empty callings
