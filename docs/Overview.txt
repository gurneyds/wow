The purpose of this application is to help Ward and Branch unit organize and manage callings. Some possible uses include:

1-) Bishopric members organizing and managing the ward callings
2-) Primary presidency organizing teachers
3-) Elders and High Priest Quorum presidencies organizing home teaching assignments
4-) Relief Society organizing visiting teaching routes
5-) Stake presidencies organizing and managing the stake callings

How it works
-------------
Member and calling data is imported into the application.
Callings are grouped by organization (Primary, YW, YM, Relief Society, Elders, High Priests, Mission etc)
Within a calling the member that currently holds that calling is shown.
The user can drag and drop names from one calling to another to explore different possibilities
There are various filters that can be applied to highlight certain information including:
  1-) Callings that need to be filled (currently empty)
  2-) Members with more than 1 calling, more than 2 callings, more than 3 callings
  3-) Members who have been in a calling for more than 90% of the expected duration
When the user is satisfied with the changes they can see a summary of the releases and callings that would need to happen.
Different named scenarios can be used to explore different possibilities
User can mark a particular release or new calling as having been completed
Once the members have been released and called, the user can "apply" the changes to update the actual callings.
